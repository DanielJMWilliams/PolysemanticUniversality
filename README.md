# Exploring the Universality of Polysemanticity in Embeddings
This project is my project for the AI Safety Fundamentals course.

Initial project idea:
- Investigating embeddings to see whether dissimilar words have similar relationships across models. If they do, it may have interesting implications for polysemanticity - perhaps polysemantic relationships are predictable and therefore more interpretable.
- My hope is that this will have relevance to polysemanticity.
- If dissimilar words are similarly related across models - polysemantic universality - this is great news. 
- If not, why not? What can we do about it?



# Setup

If you wish to run the Jupyter Notebook, I recommend using Visual Studio Code.

Prerequisites:
- Visual Studio Code with the following extensions:
    - Python
    - Jupyter

1. Clone this repository.
2. In the root folder, set up a virtual environment by running `python -m venv venv` in the terminal.
3. Activate the virtual environment using `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` in powershell.
4. Install the project dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

You're now good to go and can play with the Jupyter Notebook.
