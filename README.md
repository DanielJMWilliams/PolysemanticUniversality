# Exploring the Universality of Polysemanticity in Embeddings
This project is my project for the AI Safety Fundamentals course.

Initial project idea:
- Investigating embeddings to see whether dissimilar words have similar relationships across models. If they do, it may have interesting implications for polysemanticity - perhaps polysemantic relationships are predictable and therefore more interpretable.
- My hope is that this will have relevance to polysemanticity.
- If dissimilar words are similarly related across models - polysemantic universality - this is great news. 
- If not, why not? What can we do about it?
