# Exploring Polysemantic Universality with Embeddings
This is my project for the AI Safety Fundamentals course.

The accompanying blog post can be found here: [Polysemantic Universality](https://danieljmwilliams.github.io/DanielJMWilliams/posts/AISFProject/). I suggest reading the blog post before playing with the code yourself.


# Setup

If you wish to run the Jupyter Notebook, I recommend using Visual Studio Code.

Prerequisites:
- Visual Studio Code with the following extensions:
    - Python
    - Jupyter

1. Clone this repository.
2. In the root folder, set up a virtual environment by running `python -m venv venv` in the terminal.
3. Activate the virtual environment using `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` in powershell.
4. Install the project dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

You're now good to go and can play with the [Jupyter Notebook](/PolysemanticUniversality.ipynb).
