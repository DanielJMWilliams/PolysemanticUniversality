# Project Updates

# 01/06/2024 Project Delivery

# 25/05/2024 - Further developing the Project

# 18/05/2024 Developing the Project
- Made code more modularised and reusable.
- Interactive 3D graphs in Jupyter Notebook (note: interactivity does not seem to work in colab nor on github).
- Drafted a introduction of the idea and the motivations of the project.

# 11/05/2024 - Rapidly Testing the Project

- Setup Jupyter Notebook containing code to use pretrained embeddings models, train new embeddings models and graph their vectors.
- Trained minimal embeddings models with only a handful of words - few enough to be able to intuitively understand the embeddings.
- Experimentation with how the minimal embeddings change as dimensions increase.

Goals for next week:
- Read at least 2 relevant papers
- experiment more with minimal embeddings models. 
- Start writing up the project motivations to see if I am missing anything.


# Project Start
- Rough project idea outlined.
- Vague idea how I am going to go about it.
